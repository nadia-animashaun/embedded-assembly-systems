Embedded Systems & Computer Architecture (Assembly)

This repository showcases low-level systems programming and processor-level execution concepts implemented in Nios II assembly. The work emphasizes register-level computation, memory access patterns, stack discipline, control-flow management, and direct hardware interaction via memory-mapped I/O.

Projects demonstrate practical understanding of how software executes at the architectural level, including instruction sequencing, pointer-based memory traversal, subroutine design, register preservation, and peripheral communication using polling-based synchronization.

Platform Context
Implementations were developed targeting FPGA-based soft-core processors (Nios II) within an Intel Quartus Prime / DE1-SoC environment. Programs interface directly with hardware peripherals such as the JTAG UART using memory-mapped registers.
